Managing remote computers can be a challenging task, especially when it comes to granting administrative access to users on those computers. PowerShell provides a simple and powerful way to manage remote computers, including adding users to the local administrators group. In this blog, we will discuss how to add a user to the administrator group on a remote computer via PowerShell.

Prerequisites

PowerShell version 5.1 or later installed on the computer
Remote computer accessible via the network
Step 1: Connect to the remote computer
To manage a remote computer via PowerShell, you need to establish a remote PowerShell session. You can do this by using the Enter-PSSession cmdlet. For example, if the name of the remote computer is "remote01", the following command will create a remote PowerShell session:


Enter-PSSession -ComputerName remote01
If you need to authenticate to the remote computer, you can use the -Credential parameter with the appropriate credentials.

Step 2: Add the user to the administrator group
Once you have established a remote PowerShell session, you can use the Add-LocalGroupMember cmdlet to add a user to the administrator group. For example, if the username is "jdoe", the following command will add the user to the administrator group:

sql
Add-LocalGroupMember -Group "Administrators" -Member "jdoe"
If you need to add a domain user, you can specify the domain name before the username. For example, if the domain name is "contoso.com" and the username is "jdoe", the following command will add the user to the administrator group:

sql
Add-LocalGroupMember -Group "Administrators" -Member "contoso\jdoe"
Step 3: Verify the user is added
To verify that the user is added to the administrator group, you can use the Get-LocalGroupMember cmdlet. For example, the following command will list all the members of the administrator group:

sql
Get-LocalGroupMember -Group "Administrators"
Conclusion
PowerShell provides a simple and powerful way to manage remote computers, including adding users to the local administrators group. By using the Add-LocalGroupMember cmdlet, you can easily add a user to the administrator group on a remote computer. With this blog, you should now have a basic understanding of how to add a user to the administrator group on a remote computer via PowerShell.
